# You work at Lenâ€™s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. You
#     are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some
#     of your sales data.


# List of toppings.

# Displaying how many different pizza slices we have.

# Revamping the types of pizza slices available.

# A customer walks into the pizza store and shouts "I will have your
#     MOST EXPENSIVE pizza!". Let's sell it!

# That was the last "all in one" pizza slice, let's remove it from the
