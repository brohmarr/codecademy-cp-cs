# Project: Block Letters
# by: @Brohmarr

# ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for
#     presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from
#     individual characters.
# 
# Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials
#     of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into
#     ASCII art.
